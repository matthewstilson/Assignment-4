        For my final assignment, I was really excited to experiment with animations and create compositions that would showcase my creativity in manipulating images and text. </br> 
        For the first composition, I wanted to depict the growth and flicker of a candle flame. <br> 
        I incorporated darker colors to represent the night sky, and I found it challenging to layer and arrange the elements into a grid, but the end result was worth it.

    <p>
        The second composition was designed to symbolize growth, with animated images representing the growth of a seed into a beautiful flower. <br> 
        I used shades of purple and violet to capture the feel of a rainy, overcast day. <br> 
        I chose a curly font that resembled vines and stems to highlight the organic nature of the subject. <br> 
        The placement of the watering can proved to be a bit tricky, and I was unable to add water pouring out of the can despite my best efforts. <br> 
    </p>

    <p>
        For the third composition, I aimed to create a sense of speed and motion, with an angular, modern font and bold imagery that resembled a car speeding up. <br> 
        I used the tilt function to give the impression of acceleration and rotated the letter O's to create the effect of spinning tires. <br> 
        Finally, I added lines flying across the page to emphasize the feeling of speed and make the composition more dynamic.
